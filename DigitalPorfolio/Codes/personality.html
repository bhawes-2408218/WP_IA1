	   <div class = "discuss">
	    <p> Being an over achiever has taught me where my limits lie—and what happens when I push beyond them. The guilt that creeps in during moments of rest is relentless, whispering that I should be studying instead. My competitive nature only intensifies the pressure. I’ve been academically driven since grade one, so the urge to outperform others feels instinctive. That drive can be motivating, yes—but it’s also exhausting. The constant need to excel leaves little room to simply breathe.   	
	    Studying isn’t something I naturally love, but I’ve found creative ways to make it more engaging. What I genuinely feel passionate about is coding—even though I haven’t mastered a single programming language yet. There’s something thrilling about the logic, the structure, the potential to build something meaningful. That passion keeps me going, reminding me that learning doesn’t always have to feel like a burden.

	  <h2> My Hero- My Mom </h2>
	      <p> My mother is a strong Black woman rooted in Christ — the embodiment of faith and endurance. Despite being unemployed for much of my childhood, she never wavered in her belief that God would provide. And time and time again, He did. Her unwavering conviction has always drawn others to her, radiating strength and grace through every challenge. She lives by the words of Psalm 121:1–2: “I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.” This verse is more than a motto — it’s a lifeline she holds close to her heart.
Her example has inspired me to mend my own relationship with God and keep Him close to my heart. Through her, I’ve come to understand the weight of this world’s struggles and the profound importance of God’s presence in navigating them. I deeply admire her steadfast faith and her relentless determination to overcome every obstacle placed in her path. </p>

	  <h2> Article Review </h2>
	  <p> After reading the article "Top 20 Profitable AI Business Ideas in 2025", I discovered a range of innovative startup opportunities. Among them, the idea that resonated most with me was the development of personalized fitness and nutrition plans. As someone who constantly struggles to eat healthy and maintain a consistent weight-loss routine, this concept feels especially relevant to my everyday life. </br> </br>

	A well-designed app in this space could offer tailored meal plans, adaptive workout routines that evolve with my fitness goals, and a habit tracker to reinforce healthy behaviors. However, while the benefits are compelling, there are important ethical considerations to address. </br> </br>

	One major concern is data security. Since the app would collect sensitive personal information—such as health metrics, dietary preferences, and possibly even genetic data—it’s crucial that this data is protected. A potential solution is to implement strong encryption protocols, ensuring that even if the data is compromised, it remains unreadable and unusable to unauthorized parties. </br> </br>

	Another issue is algorithmic bias. If the AI is trained on data that primarily represents a specific demographic, it may produce recommendations that are unsuitable or ineffective for users outside that group. To mitigate this, developers must ensure the AI is trained on diverse, inclusive datasets that reflect a wide range of body types, cultural diets, and fitness needs. </br> </br>

	A popular app that already operates in this space is MyFitnessPal. It helps users track their calorie intake, monitor fitness progress, and generate personalized meal plans. It’s a great example of how AI can support healthier lifestyles—though it also highlights the importance of ethical design in health-related technologies. </br> </br>
