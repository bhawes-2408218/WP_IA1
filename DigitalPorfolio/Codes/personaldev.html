	    <h2> Chapter 4 </h2>
	      <p> Michael meets Charlie at Mack's Diner, known to be popular among maintenance men. They reconnected over coffee where they discussed life, relationships and personal growth. Michael expressed how Charlie's earlier mentioned metaphor "treat relationships like gardens" helped him with is marriage through his consistent dedication of time and attention to his wife, Amy. The conversation then shifted to Michael's disappointment in his stagnant career, prompting Charlie to introduce him to goal-setting. Charlie went on to explain the importance of writing down one's goals and the power it has on the brain's awareness. He shared the wisdom of Mr Davis that setting goals is more than just what you want to achieve, but how you reach those goals are far more valuable. Charlie then breaks down how setting goals work—long-range goal, mid-range goal, short-range goal, micro-goals. He used the example of saving $50,000 to start a business in 5 years, saving $850 a month through discipline. </p>

	    <h2> Reflection </h2>
	      <p> Reading this chapter has given me a powerful insight into the importance of writing down my goals. It made me realize how simply making my brain aware of those goals can significantly increase the likelihood of achieving them. I now see the value in journaling my goals and organizing them into clear categories—short-term, mid-term, and long-term. More importantly, it’s helped me understand that the true reward lies not just in reaching the goals, but in the growth and transformation that happens along the way. The journey itself is what shapes me into the person I aspire to become. </p>

	    <h2> Chapter 5 </h2>
	      <p> Michael and Charlie continue their conversation over refilled cups of coffee. Michael expresses feeling overwelmed by the responsibilities he have and no way of pursuing his goals. Charlie shares more knowledge from Mr Davis where a person suffers from one of 2 pains, discipline or regret. He emphasizes how precious each day is, and encourages Michael to take charge of his life, make use of the time he has. Charlie then expresses how people fall into the trap of focusing on urgent demands rather than what's actually important, their goals in life. He warns that not designing your own life plan leaves you likely in someone else's life plan, which includes little for you. Just then, Michael's pager interrupts, which is the urgent demand. Just before leaving, he promises to stay in touch with Charlie before finally departing to handle work.</p>

	    <h2> Reflection </h2> 
	     <p> This chapter has truly opened my eyes to the importance of intentionally planning my life. It’s unsettling to think that the demands and distractions of daily responsibilities could keep me from reaching the goals I’ve set for myself. I want to live with purpose—aligning my actions with the vision I have for my future—so that I don’t look back with regret over missed opportunities or unfulfilled potential. My aim is to design a life that reflects my goals, not just react to circumstances, and to ensure that when the time comes, I can say I gave my dreams every chance to flourish.</p>

	    <h2> Chapter 6 </h2>
	      <p> After three weeks from their previous meeting at the diner, Michael visits Charlie at Twelve Pillars to share his life progress: his marriage is thriving and his completion of documenting his 100 life goals. He shared how writing his goals down sparked motivation, to which Charlie congratulated him on. Charlie then introduces him to the next Pillar of Success, "Surrounding Yourself with the Best People". Charlie encourages him to evaluate the influence his friends have on his life growth. He introduces Mr Davis's teaching of categorizing associates into 3 categories: Disassociation, limited association and expanded association. Charlie then urges Michael to be intentional about who he spends time with, to which Michael struggles with the thought of distancing himself from his longtime friends. To attract successful people, Charlie explains, Michael must work on making himself successful. Personal development is the key to better associations, greater network, new knowledge, greater opportunities and an improved attitude. Although the new teaching is tough, Michael expresses his intention of being ready to embrace the changes. </p>

	    <h2> Reflection </h2>
	      <p> This chapter has prompted deep reflection on my relationships—whether with friends, family, or acquaintances—and how they influence my behavior and mindset. It’s made me more aware of the subtle impact others have on my growth, and the importance of surrounding myself with people who uplift and inspire. I’ve learned that by focusing on my own personal development, I can naturally attract successful, driven individuals into my life—people who bring with them valuable opportunities, meaningful connections, and fresh perspectives that fuel my journey forward. </p>

	    <h2> Chapter 7 </h2>
	      <p> Charlie teches Michael the next Pillar of Success: lifelong learning. He explains that formal educations helps you earn a living, self-education builds fortune. He quotes Mr Davis and Thoreau to emphasize that most people stop learning after school, which leads to stagnation. He encourages Michael to embrace self-learning through reading, observing successful people and reflecting on personal experiences. At first, Michael esisted the idea of reading but Charlie argued the value that comes with reading. He insisted that Michael read at least one book before their next meeting. Michael agrees to give it a try, realizing that learning is important in the process of his transformation. Charlie gave him a copy of 'The Magic of Thinking Big' from Mr Davis's recommended list as a start. As Michael departs from Charlie, he starts to feel a deep sense of gratitude for Charlie who was becoming a father figure to him.  </p>

	    <h2> Reflection </h2>
	      <p> I’ve come to realize that while I enjoy reading, I haven’t been choosing the kinds of books that truly nourish growth. By being more intentional with my reading choices, I believe I can begin to absorb deeper wisdom and gain meaningful insights into life. As the chapter emphasized, self-education is the foundation of both fortune and wisdom—and even the wisest individuals continue learning every day. Shifting my focus toward books that challenge and inspire me will be a powerful step in my journey of personal development. </p>
